1. Minimal required items:
  a. 1 * RGB LED
  b. 3 * resistors for RGB (220ohm or 330ohm but you can go higher to dim the light and not
     hurt your eyes, as long as it’s visible)
  c. 3 * potentiometers
  d. Wires
  e. Arduino
  f. Connector cable
2. Task:
  a. Read the values of the potentiometers
  b. Use each value to directly control one of the RGB colors
  c. Name of the file should be suggestive. A good example is analogRGBControl, but you’re
     free to choose something else
  d. Upload the file to the git repository, in the lab homeworkes folder:
    <username>/IntrodutionToRobotics/LaboratoryHomework
  e. Edit the README.md (in the LaboratoryHomework folder) by adding the file name
     and a short description.
